2022 Q1 Marketing Report

In this Python project, I analyzed marketing data (90 records of analytics data, 45,211 records of leads data, and 20,736 records of campaign data) at a fictional small online seller and presented my findings to the marketing team at the end of the first quarter.

The questions I answered include:
1. What were the KPI values for the quarter?
2. Which demographic groups generated the most revenue?
3. What does our sales funnel look like going into the second quarter?
4. What was our ROI for the purchase of those leads if they cost $50K?
5. Were our email campaigns at the end of January (A) and beginning of March (B) effective? 
6. Which marketing campaign was more successful, A or B?

In summary:
1. Purchase more leads. The recent purchase led to a 326% return on investment.
2. Target high-income 30-50-year-olds. They generate the most revenue.
3. Continue email campaigns. Both campaigns were successful in increasing views and purchases. Campaign B somewhat performed better than Campaign A based on KPIs; therefore, our next step is to determine the reason for this outcome.
